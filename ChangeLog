        Modified the demo version of Analysis.cxx to analyse our data, that is however still untested and uncleaned. Updated the names of the variables. Using date.h to try changing the format of YYYY-MM-DD to numbers from 1 to 365. Implemented formulas to calculate mean temperature and errors. Should produce a histogram.

        Changed the read_csv function to read the csv file that we want and change it into raw data that is stored in
        a vector called data in main. The data vector has elements that are of the Measurement class that stores three variables: date, time and temperature. They can be retrieved with 
        data[0].get_date();
        data[0].get_time();
        data[0].get_temperature();
        
        Changed the Measurement class by adding validation checks and fixing errors.

        Added a directory_cleaning() function that removes the new data files created by the cleaning() function.

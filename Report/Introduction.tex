\section{Introduction}
During this project, we analyzed several temperature measurement datasets from 
"SMHI - Sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut", where three analyses were performed. 
The first one calculated the mean temperature and standard deviation for each day for all the years in dataset. 
The second one finds the warmest and coldest days in each year and sums them up in one histogram. 
It also includes a Gaussian fit of the warmest days. The third analysis counts the days above 25 degree Celcius 
in each year, counts them up and then plots the count of the number of days against all the years. \\

We chose Andreas as our release manager, and Ellen and Verena were developers. During this report, we will talk about 
our results of the three analyses, our methods on how to get there by talking about our implemented functions and 
conclude with potential future improvements.
